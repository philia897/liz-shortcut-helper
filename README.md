# Liz Shortcut Helper

A Rust-based helper for those who can not remember all the shortcuts (especially those rarely used ones), which supports:

 - Show shortcuts with great filtering function based on [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/)

 - Automatically execute the selected shortcut using [ydotool](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool)

 - Customize the shortcuts and add whatever shortcut or command you want.

The project name is inspired by a great animation named "Liz and the Blue bird"
